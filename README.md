# Efficient ML Course Assignments (MIT 6.5940 Fall 2024)

This repository contains my solutions for the **TinyML and Efficient Deep Learning Computing (6.5940)** course taught by [Prof. Song Han](https://efficientml.ai/) at MIT.

The course covers efficient deep learning techniques such as pruning, quantization, neural architecture search, and efficient deployment of large-scale models.
